# DonAndres_666


As a custom maps developer for the video game Call Of Duty Black Ops 3, I have created maps highly popular within the community, with over 250,000 players enjoying my creations. 
I have been globally recognized, winning global contest :
- "$10,000 Movie Map Contest" for "The Cinema Challenge"
- "$10,000 Halloween Map Contest" for "SAW: Brainbreaker"
- "$10,000 Videogames Map Contest" for "Cybertower Impossible Challenge"

The potential of my maps lies in puzzle design and the amount of scripting involved. Additionally, the originality and proposal of ideas that haven't been seen in other maps contribute to their appeal. In this hub, I share the scripts of my maps for fellow developers to reference and draw inspiration from.

**Workshop Link:** https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2996448468<br>
**Description:** This map was submitted to the "$10,000 Movie Map Contest" worldwide map contest and won one of the prizes. The map featured the "8 doors challenge" concept, which was invented by me and has been used in numerous maps. Each room was inspired by a movie, and in each one, you had to overcome a challenge related to that movie.<br>

### Chiquipark
**Release date:** February 3, 2022<br>
**Workshop Link:** https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2741670509<br>
**Complete Gameplay:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQq0iLJfmJU<br>
**Description:** My most highly rated map. With a total of over 100,000 players and a 90% positive rating, this can be considered my most significant map. The uniqueness of this map is that to activate the drink machines, electricity, and PAP, players had to overcome challenges in the style of Wipeout. I made it thinking it would be my last map, but it was so well received that I felt motivated to continue developing more maps.<br>

### Retro Arcade Challenge
**Release date:** September 23, 2021<br>
**Workshop Link:** https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2609608842<br>
**Trailer:** https://youtu.be/8jl-rx87RTs<br>
**World Record Gameplay:** https://youtu.be/1FUiNdEcp9w<br>
**Description:** For me, my best map and the one that made a name for me among map creators. This map follows the "8 doors challenge" philosophy that I had proposed earlier. In this case, each room was based on a retro arcade game, and in each one, you had to overcome a mini-game related to it. It probably had less impact than some of my other maps due to its high difficulty. Still, I added a timing system so people could compete to complete it in the shortest time possible. I never imagined the number of people who would compete to beat the record. In terms of map concept, I am clear that this is the one I am most proud of.<br>

### CyberTower Impossible Challenge
**Release date:** May 01, 2024 process<br>
**Workshop Link:** https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3236566667<br>
**Description:** This map was a winner on the "$10,000 Videogames Map Contest" worldwide map contest. It's a highly detailed map based on the video game Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of work behind it, and it turned out to be one of my best contributions to the workshop.<br>

### SAW:BREAKING BRAIN
**Release date:** In development process<br>
**Workshop Link:** In development process<br>
**Description:** This map was submitted to the "$10,000 Halloween Map Contest" worldwide map contest and won one of the prizes. The map was submitted to the contest without being 100% finished, so it cannot be played publicly yet. This map features unique puzzles that have never been seen before in a BO3 map. For example, introducing your real-time hour to open a door. This is done through a script in .csc that combines with the map's .gsc script. That's why the .csc is also published on this GitHub repository.<br>
